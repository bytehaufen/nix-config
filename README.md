This repository contains my personal NixOS and Home Manager configuration files.

I use [Nix flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) for managing the configuration.

## How to use

TBD

## Prerequisites

> TODO: Replace by nix's hook.

Git hook for auto formatting of `.nix` files on commit can be installed with

```shell
./scripts/create-hook-symlink.sh
```

<!-- Deprecated start --->

## Build the Home Manager configuration

- Building and activating via direct Nix command:

  ```shell
  # Build configuration
  nix build ".#homeConfigurations.rico@arch.activationPackage"

  # Activate configuration
  ./result/activate
  ```

- Or using Home Manager's built-in command:

  ```shell
  home-manager switch --flake ".#rico@arch"
  ```

## Shorthands

For frequently used commands like `home-manager switch ...`, utilize _just_ for
simplification. To see all available commands with just, execute:

```shell
just
```
